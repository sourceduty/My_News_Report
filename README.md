[My News Report](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-DsxHRv40P-my-news-report) was developed to assist users in developing personalized news reports by sourcing information from reputable news sources. It helps users compile and summarize the latest news into a coherent and concise report. By leveraging its capabilities, users can stay informed on current events without needing to sift through numerous articles and sources themselves.

My News Report operates through a step-by-step, multiple-choice process to guide users in selecting the type of news they are interested in. Users can choose between national or international news, ensuring that the content is tailored to their preferences. This systematic approach ensures that users receive the most relevant and up-to-date information in an organized manner.

Additionally, My News Report offers the option to create custom images for the report using DALL-E 3, enhancing the visual appeal and engagement of the news content. Users are prompted to decide if they want an image to accompany their report, adding a layer of customization and creativity. This feature allows for a more dynamic and visually enriched news experience, catering to the diverse needs and interests of the users.
